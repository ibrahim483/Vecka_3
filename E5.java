Above average.
According to the course book, 90% of incoming college students
rate themselves as above average.

This program that takes a command-line argument n,
reads in n integers from standard input,
and prints the fraction of values that are strictly above the average
value.

Example of use including expected output:

java E5 10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
5 of 10 values were above the average 5.5

*/

/*
Your task is to complete the program under
  // Your code here

The program will need to store the values read from standard input
because it needs to go throught the values again after calculating
the average.
